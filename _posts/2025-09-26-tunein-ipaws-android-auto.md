If you have given up on AM and FM in favor of streaming in the car, there is some good news. [TuneIn](https://tunein.com/) is now delivering **real-time emergency alerts** inside its automotive app, thanks to a partnership with [FEMA’s Integrated Public Alert & Warning System](https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/practitioners/integrated-public-alert-warning-system), better known as IPAWS.  

## Android Automotive Alert Integration

As [Radio World explains](https://www.radioworld.com/news-and-business/tunein-offers-ipaws-alerts-through-android-auto), the alerts work on Android Automotive, the built-in dashboard OS running in cars from Volvo, GM, and Polestar. This is different from Android Auto, even though the names often get mixed. The effect is the same: you are streaming music, talk radio, or a podcast, and then a banner or an audio interruption tells you something serious is happening nearby.  

## Severity-Based Alert Scaling

[Inside Radio adds](https://www.insideradio.com/free/tunein-fema-partner-to-deliver-real-time-emergency-alerts-to-drivers/article_d99a10c2-e5c0-4408-b209-61d6bc203b6a.html) that the system scales by severity. A minor advisory might just appear on screen. A tornado warning can actually pause the audio and read the alert out loud. It is geo-targeted, smart, and feels like the kind of safety net that should have existed years ago.  

## Broadcast Radio Remains Essential

This is not a replacement for traditional alerts. **AM, FM, and NOAA Weather Radio still carry the load** when everything else fails. Broadcast does not depend on your cell network, your app updates, or whether your carmaker pushes a software patch. When things get rough, radio is still the backbone.  

## Streaming Supplements Traditional EAS

What TuneIn has done is fill in the gaps. Think of it as a supplement to the EAS ecosystem. It keeps people informed who never touch terrestrial radio, especially younger drivers who spend their entire commute inside streaming apps and smartphone projection systems.  

## CarPlay Integration Still Missing

CarPlay is the missing piece. There is no word yet on when, or if, [Apple](https://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/) will get the same treatment. That leaves millions of drivers without this feature, and that feels like a major miss. Android drivers can now get emergency alerts while streaming. Apple drivers are still waiting.  

## Expanding Alerts Beyond Streaming

Looking ahead, the same logic applies to other platforms. If TuneIn can integrate IPAWS, why not Netflix, Hulu, Spotify, or YouTube Music? Imagine a quiet, verified alert overlay during your show or playlist. Not the jarring tones of legacy EAS, just a clear local message that keeps you in the know.  

For now, TuneIn’s move is one of the clearest examples of what a modern emergency alert system should look like. **Radio remains the backbone. Streaming finally joins as backup.**
