After the New Year, I am retiring the Fully Modulated name and bringing everything under a new banner: The Tyler Woodward Project. This is not a new show or a reset, it is simply a better reflection of what I actually do and what I want to talk about going forward.

When I launched Fully Modulated, I wanted a space to talk about broadcasting. I have spent my career in and around transmitters, studios, RF chains, STL links, and all of the weird glue that keeps radio and TV stations on the air. That focus helped me get started and it attracted some great listeners who care about the same things. Over the last year, though, I have realized that tying everything to “broadcasting” in the title makes it feel like I am not allowed to wander outside the transmitter building.

In reality, my day job and my interests cover a much wider slice of technology. I spend just as much time on networking, security, automation, data privacy, and the broader tech stack that supports media as I do on traditional RF. I also live in Linux terminals, self-hosted services, and open source tools, and I care a lot about the communities and philosophies behind them. I enjoy talking about routing, firewalls, protocols, logging, privacy tooling, and the open source projects that make all of that possible for both hobbyists and professionals.

The Tyler Woodward Project gives me room to bring all of that into the same feed without feeling like I am breaking my own premise. It is me, it is who I am, and it reflects the way my brain actually jumps between topics in the real world. I might talk about firewalls one week, social media issues the next, and then dive into audio over IP, streaming chains, or some strange bug I chased down at a transmitter site.

Here is what is actually changing. The name will change from Fully Modulated to The Tyler Woodward Project. The logo and visual branding will get a refresh to match that new identity. The website and social accounts will be updated to point to the new name. New episodes will not be limited to broadcast engineering, they will also dive into general tech, networking, cybersecurity, Linux, open source, and whatever else I am building, fixing, or breaking in a given week.

Here is what is not changing. I am still the host. The format, tone, and style are staying the same. I still want this to feel like sitting down with a fellow engineer who explains things clearly and is not afraid to nerd out over details or show config snippets and shell commands. If you subscribe to the show now, you do not have to touch anything. The feed is the same, the archive stays online, and your app will simply start showing the new name and artwork once the switch happens. Your podcast follows stay exactly the same and most of the social media accounts you already know will stay the same too.

If you want to follow along elsewhere, you can find me on Threads, Instagram, and Bluesky as @tylerwoodward.me. Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and YouTube will all convert over to the new name when the time comes, so you can keep listening wherever you already are without changing a thing.

I have spent almost a year working on Fully Modulated as a brand. It has been fun to design, build the site, and see those first downloads and messages roll in. At the same time, I can feel the limits of the original framing every time I sit down to plan content. The Tyler Woodward Project is my way of fixing that. It lets me keep everything that works while opening the door to broader tech and open source conversations I have wanted to have all along.

So if you have enjoyed Fully Modulated, thank you. You are coming with me. Same host, same brain, same curiosity, just with a name that feels a little more honest about what this thing actually is and where it is going.
