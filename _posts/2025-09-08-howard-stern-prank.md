The King of All Media strikes again. Howard Stern pulled off one of his most elaborate pranks yet, convincing major news outlets and fans that he was leaving SiriusXM for good. But it was all just another classic Stern bit that fooled everyone from the Associated Press to countless radio fans.

The elaborate setup began during the summer with a series of false rumors. First came reports that co-host Robin Quivers had died, followed by claims that Stern was fired from SiriusXM for being "too woke." Instead of shutting down these rumors immediately, Stern decided to lean into them and create an even bigger story.

## The Morning That Fooled Everyone

The prank reached its peak when Stern opened his show with a segment featuring Andy Cohen. Cohen delivered what sounded like a genuine farewell, saying, "I know you're expecting a big announcement from Howard and this is not how things were meant to go. This was supposed to be a cleaner hand off."

Cohen continued with convincing emotion: "I can't overstate what Howard has meant to this company and what he did for SiriusXM. He walked so that we could run. I can't possibly fill his void."

The bit was so convincing that the Associated Press fell for it completely, publishing breaking news alerts and a full story announcing Stern's departure from SiriusXM. Other publications quickly picked up the story, spreading the false news across the internet.

## The Truth Behind the Headlines

After letting the prank run its course, Stern revealed the truth. He explained how he decided to play into all the false rumors that had been circulating about him and his show. The radio legend admitted that while the rumors were completely made up, they did have one positive side effect. Many other companies reached out with offers to pick up his show, proving his continued value in the industry.

However, Stern made it clear that he's very happy at SiriusXM and has no plans to leave. While he didn't announce a new contract during the show, SiriusXM CEO Jennifer Witz recently commented at an investment conference, saying, "I think he's been core to our platform for over 20 years. So I'm confident we'll get to the right place."

## Why This Prank Worked So Well

This wasn't just a random joke. Stern carefully built up the narrative over months, allowing rumors to grow and spread naturally. The summer had been filled with speculation about his future, contract negotiations, and various other stories. By the time the Andy Cohen segment aired, people were primed to believe that something big was happening.

The prank also highlights how quickly news spreads in today's media landscape. Within hours of the fake announcement, major news outlets were reporting Stern's "departure" without double-checking the source. It's a reminder of how even established news organizations can get caught up in the rush to break news first.

## What This Means for Stern's Future

While the departure was fake, the underlying contract situation is real. Stern's current deal with SiriusXM is set to expire, and negotiations for a new contract are ongoing. The fact that other companies reached out during the prank shows there's still strong interest in the Howard Stern Show across the industry.

For now, though, fans can rest easy knowing that the King of All Media isn't going anywhere. He's still broadcasting from his home studio, still causing controversy, and apparently still capable of fooling the entire media industry with a well-crafted prank.

## Conclusion

Howard Stern's fake departure prank proves that even after decades in radio, he can still surprise everyone. The elaborate setup, convincing performance by Andy Cohen, and the media's quick reaction created a perfect storm that had fans genuinely worried about losing their favorite shock jock.

It's classic Stern: turning rumors and speculation into content while demonstrating just how much influence he still has in the media world. Whether you love him or hate him, you have to admit that getting the Associated Press to publish fake news about your retirement is pretty impressive.
