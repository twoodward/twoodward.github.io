Coaxial switch controller manufacturer **[Tunwall Radio](https://tunwallradio.com/)** has announced plans to close following the upcoming retirement of its owners, Steve and Leslie Tunwall. The company will accept orders through December 2025, with production scheduled to conclude sometime in the first quarter of 2026. Founded in 2004 with a single switch controller, Tunwall Radio has grown to serve broadcasters for over two decades. 

Over the years, **Tunwall Radio** expanded its product line to include dual, multi-switch, and advanced [SNMP-enabled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Network_Management_Protocol) units. Their widely-used [TRC Series](https://tunwallradio.com/trc-series-controllers-2) featured **programmable logic controllers** ([PLC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmable_logic_controller)) and universal switch compatibility in a compact design.

Steve Tunwall is also recognized for designing and building [AM directional phasor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phasor_(radio)) and transmitter control systems—solutions found in broadcast sites across the U.S. and Canada.

Steve Tunwall engineered one of our **station switchers** for two different FM stations. Each was equipped with both a main and backup transmitter. His innovative system allowed routing between their respective **main antennas** or a **shared backup antenna**, featuring impressive cable routing, sophisticated PLC programming, and robust SNMP functions throughout. The result was truly a **work of heart**—providing exceptional flexibility, reliability, and control to our facility.

Tunwall controllers, including models from the TRC Series, currently operate in AM, FM, and TV transmitter sites throughout North America. Their programmable and universal compatibility design, along with SNMP and PLC integration, has made them an essential part of modern [broadcasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcasting) infrastructure and [FCC](https://www.fcc.gov/engineering-technology) compliance.

Warranty support for all products will remain in place following the company’s closure. Resources and technical support will continue to be available at [Tunwall Radio's official website](https://tunwallradio.com) after production ends, ensuring that broadcasters who rely on these controllers will not be left without assistance.

Steve and Leslie Tunwall would like to thank their customers and broadcast equipment dealers for their support and loyalty over the last 21 years. Their dedication and engineering skill have left a lasting legacy in broadcast technology.
