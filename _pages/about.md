I'm Tyler Woodward, and broadcasting has always been in my blood. My journey began as a high school volunteer at a public access station in Tampa, running cameras, mixing audio, producing shows, and helping out with TV production classes. I also took journalism, deepening my love for telling stories and connecting with audiences on air and behind the scenes.

To take it further, I studied radio and television production at the Connecticut School of Broadcasting and interned at WWBA and WHBO. My big break came in 2014 at WRQT-95.7 The Rock in La Crosse, Wisconsin, where I worked across programming, air shifts, editing spots, board op’ing sports, and remote events before joining the engineering department in 2018. I spent three years repairing transmissions, managing automation and STLs, handling satellite receivers, and administering IT. In 2021, I moved into broadcast engineering at a larger scale, and by 2025, I became a broadcast network engineer focused on interconnects, remote systems, audio codecs, and the statewide delivery of radio and television.

> Now I focus on interconnects, remote systems, audio codecs, and the delivery of radio and television across a statewide network.

On a personal note, I'm married to a Minnesota girl—she stole me from Florida and brought me to the Midwest. We have two wonderful boys and a life I feel incredibly blessed to live. I love tinkering with Linux and open source software, writing scripts, and working out creative tech solutions. This blog is where I share my journey, ideas, and expertise with fellow engineers, tech enthusiasts, and anyone interested in broadcasting’s inner workings.
